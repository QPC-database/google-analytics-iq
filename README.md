A Small tool that parses the answers for the questions of Google Analytics IQ exam and displays on the screen. It uses School4Seo blog for the keys. At some cases scripts fails to get the answer (in ~5-7 questions) as the slug on the blog is not the slug generated by the back end.

Can be used together with [JavaScript Injector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-injector/djnjegpffahmfpjdlkciiecmeaebghlk?hl=en).
